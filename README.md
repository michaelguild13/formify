# formify
Formify makes it so you can make editable markup wherever you want.
It's built in pure Js so you can add it to whatever framework you want without worry of dependencies

***This is a work in progress***

To use: create a form and give it an id of "formify"
from there, put your inputs or what have you, wherever you want and formify will turn it into visual content that can be editable on the fly.

ex:
<form id="formify" method="ajax" action="url here">
<input name="name" placeholder="your name" value="john doe" required />
</form>
